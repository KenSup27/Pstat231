##### An overview of dataset
The data set contains the open price, close price, highest price, lowest price, volume, and adjusted. 
I get the data from historical Tesla stock data from yahoo. 
I can separate the data set into 95% of the data be observations, and left 5% be predictor.
I am working on the numeric data. 
There is no missing data, and I have no idea how to do with my data. 

##### An overview of my research question
I am interested in predicting price of Tesla stock. 
The research question will be answered with a regression approach.
I think the goal of my project is predictive as I am going to predict the stock price of Tesla with lowest errors. 

##### Proposed project timeline
I plan to start my EDA after my memo gets approved. In order to be clear about what I am going to do and how to analysis, I may need to ask more questions to the Professor and TA. 

##### Questions or conserns
I think for this question, we need to apply the time series to do the prediction. I do not know how to apply the time series to predict the stock prices. 

1. TSLA stock price (daily) variance???
2. Inflation rate/CPI (monthly)
3. Unemployment rate (monthly)
4. 汇率
5. nasdak index
