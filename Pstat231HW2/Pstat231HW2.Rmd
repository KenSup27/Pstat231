##### Question 1
```{r read dataset Question 1}
data1 <- read.csv('D:/Github/Pstat131/homework-2/homework-2/data/abalone.csv') # import dataset
age <- data1[9]+1.5 # extract the rings column since age = rings+1.5
data2 <- cbind(data1,age) # add a new column into the dataframe
names(data2)[10] <- 'age' # rename the new column as age
ggplot(data2, aes(age))+
  geom_histogram(col='white', binwidth = 1) # plot the age column using histogram to make it access.
```
The distribution of age is more likely a normal distribution with positive skew.

##### Question 2
```{r Question 2 Data Split}
set.seed(4177) # set seed to make sure the output is stable
abalone.split <- initial_split(data2, prop = 0.80) # split the data set, then what is the appropriate percentage, may need a new data set since we cannot include rings and age????
abalone.training <- training(abalone.split) # this is training data set
abalone.testing <- testing(abalone.split) # this is testing data set
abalone.training
```
