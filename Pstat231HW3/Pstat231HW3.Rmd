```{r package installed, include=FALSE}
library(tidymodels)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(corrr)
```

```{r dataset load}
df <- read.csv('/Users/wentaoyu/Documents/UCSB File/Stats/Pstat131/HWs/homework-3/data/titanic.csv')
```
## Question 1
```{r}
set.seed(891) # keep the outcome stable
titanic_split <- initial_split(df, prop = 0.80, strata = survived) # split the data and stratified on survived
titanic_training <- training(titanic_split) # extract the training data
titanic_testing <- testing(titanic_split) # extract the testing data
# titanic_training
# titanic_testing
```
## Question 2
```{r explore the distributio of survived variable}
ggplot(titanic_training, aes(survived))+
  geom_bar()
```
From the graph, this looks like a () distribution. 

## Question 3
```{r}
cor_titanic <- titanic_training %>% 
  select(-c(survived, name, sex, ticket, cabin, embarked)) %>%  # eliminate chr type elements
  correlate()
cor_titanic
rplot(cor_titanic) # plot the correlation between continuous elements. 
```
Explanation: ticket class is negative correlated with customer fares, which mean larger number of ticket class leads to lower customer fares. This makes sense since 1st class is the best which costs more. 

## Question 4
```{r dummy recipe}
titanic_training
```
